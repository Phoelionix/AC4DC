Each atomic species has a set of three rate files attached to it (Auger, Fluorescence, Photoionisation), which are represent the rate of the respective processes undergone by species with the configuration shown in `index.txt`


Currently, densities are outputted with respect to the final energy knot grid, which tends to be poor at fitting earlier times.
