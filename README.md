# AC4DC
Atomic/plasma code for XFEL damage simulations.

The code simulates the changes in electronic structure of a atoms in bulk of a micro-crystal or amorphous media as it is illuminated by an X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) pulse. An independent atom approximation is adopted to represent a molecule as a collection of independent atoms, submerged into a bath of electrons that are formed as a result of ionization.

### Installation

Compile script "compile_script.sh" is located in the script folder. Change 'g++' (linux, Ubuntu) to your compiler if required. The line "#include <eigen3/Eigen/Dense>" in the header file "EigenSolver.h" should reflect the location of the Eigen 3 library.  

### Dependencies:

+ Eigen 3        (vector algebra library, http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)
+ Wigner Symbols (3-j and 6-j symbols, https://github.com/joeydumont/wignerSymbols)
+ OpenMP         (multi-threading, https://www.openmp.org/)

### Key Approximations:

1. All atoms interact with X-rays independent of each other.
2. At any time, an atom is described by an average-over-configuration state.
3. Time evolution of atoms is described by a system of coupled rate equation (perturbation theory).
4. Electron plasma is split into two components - energetic photo-electrons and cold secondary electrons.
5. Photo-electrons have delta-function distribution around time-dependent average kinetic energy. No three-body recombination (TBR) for photo-electrons, which can escape the sample.
6. Secondary electrons have Boltzmann distribution with time-dependent number density and temperature. They are assumed to be trapped at all times. Electron impact ionisation (EII) and TBR are determined by average number density of secondary electrons over the volume of a sample.

## Output format

In the Rates folder, the program stores a series of data files in the format
`[ rate value ] [ configuration transitioned to ] [ energy of transition ]`
Corresponding lines in the `index.txt` file explain which configuration this corresponds to..



### TODO

1. Untangle the photoionization/Auger/eii rate calculations and actual rate equation solution into two different executables
2. Develop a parallel executable to the above approach that performs a full Boltzmann equation solution rather than assuming primary electrons..
