#VOLUME
20000        // Volume per molecule in Angstrom^3.
500         // Length scale of sample in Angstrom. Used for effective escape rate of photo-electrons (assumes surrounded by a void).
none // Spatial boundary shape - options are none, spherical, cylindrical, planar

#PULSE
7112         // Photon energy in eV.
15           // Pulse width in femtoseconds (defined as FWHM for Gaussian pulse).
gaussian       // Pulse shape

#USE_COUNT
true    // active (using count)?
0.0275  // Number of photons in trillions (10^12) in a 100 nm diameter spot. (3.5e12 um-2)

#NUMERICAL
20000       // Initial guess for number of time step points for rate equation.        If loading time, then the time steps should be whatever gives the time step density at end of sim. (TODO make this automatic or change input to be time step width)
18            // Number of threads in OpenMP.

#DYNAMIC_GRID
l              // Grid regions preset, options are: dismal, low, medium, high, (referring to accuracy),  and no_dirac (static region is used rather than dynamic dirac regions)

Notes:
Parameters approximate (pump) pulse used in Nass et al 2020 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7156470/

Ignores:
- precipitant (NaCl)
- surrounding water, which would filter photoelectron distribution in crystal with own.
    - If photoelectrons aren't slowed by boundary significantly, this is on a timescale shorter 
    than the pulse.
- spatial boundary, since the water droplet size is unknown

from many runs, distributions are very well-approximated by low accuracy grid, 
for the purposes of both a) atomic form factor determination and b) debye length 
determination for hybrid models.
