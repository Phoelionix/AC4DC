// Template file, more detailed explanations of parameter options are included here.

// Determines the composition, and is used alongside the volume per molecule to determine the atomic density.
// These atoms must be defined in AC4DC/input/atoms. C.inp defines C, and so on.  
#ATOMS

// Loose geometrical aspects of the target. 
// The most important parameter is the volume per molecule, as it determines the density of the atoms. 
#VOLUME
20000.00      // Volume per molecule in Angstrom^3.
2000         // Radius of a sample in Angstrom. Used for effective escape rate of photo-electrons.
none         // Spatial boundary shape - options are none (confined system), spherical, cylindrical, planar.

//
#PULSE
9000         // Photon energy in eV.
40.0         // Pulse-dependent definition of duration in femtoseconds: FWHM for Gaussian pulse, pulse width for square pulse.
gaussian       // Pulse shape (square or gaussian). Note that t = 0 fs is defined as the end of the pulse and the peak of the pulse respectively.
5 //  Total simulation time in fwhm (so 200 fs in this case). <Optional, default = 2.4> 
1.2  //  (Gaussian pulse shape only) time before pulse peak to start at in fwhm.  <Optional, default = 1.2> 

//------Fluence--------
//// Various measures to determine the pulse's amplitude are provided for convenience.  
//// Important: Only one of these options should be enabled.

// Total photon count per unit area   
#USE_COUNT
true          // enabled? true/false.
10.00         // Photon density (x10^12 ph.Âµm-2)

// Total fluence 
#USE_FLUENCE
false         // enabled? true/false.
25         // Pulse fluence in 10^4 * J/cm^2.

// Maximum intensity
#USE_INTENSITY
false         // enabled? true/false.
15            // Maximum intensity in 10^19 * W/cm^2. Will give different fluence between square and gaussian.

//-------Grid---------
//// Grid settings, with a choice of a dynamic or static (manual) grid.  Only one of these categories 
//// should be included. The manual grid is disabled by default. 

// Dynamic grid settings. Presets are defined in AC4DC/src/DynamicRegions.cpp.
// New presets can be defined, but must be added to input options in AC4DC/include/GridSpacing.hpp
#DYNAMIC_GRID
medium          // Grid regions preset, options are 'low', 'medium', 'high', (accuracy) among others (see README).
10         // Grid update period in fs, (dynamic grid only).

// Allows for an arbitrary static grid to be defined. 
// NB: The transition/cutoff energy for electrons to be considered thermalised is also static with this method.
#MANUAL_GRID
false               // Use manual grid? If false (the default), dynamic grid is used.
2000                // Transition energy.  The temperature, and thus coulomb logarithm, is approximated by calculating the equilibrium definition of temperature for the energy distribution below this cutoff.
1|30|110|120        // manual grid boundary indices, with point at 0 excluded. No spaces. Last point overrides num free-e pnts for now. TODO could make it the num electrons in region or smth?
4|100|3000|10000    // manual grid boundary energies, with point at 0 excluded. No spaces. 2.8571 is what I thought the min value that corresponds to the original powerlaw grid was but it isn't. 
1|1|2               // power law for each region to follow. In this example, 10 points follow a square power distribution between 3 and 10 keV.
//--------------------

// The initial guess for number of steps generally should be kept above 500-1000. The number of steps are increased 
// automatically by the solver when divergence is detected in the free-electron distribution. 
// However, it does not check for convergence in the atomic/bound states.
#NUMERICAL
5000        // Initial guess for number of time step points for rate equation.
18           // Number of threads in OpenMP (i.e. maximum number of parallel threads to be used by the program).

// Determines output data's fineness in dimensions of time and energy. The output folder will be < 50 MB with these settings.
#OUTPUT
800          // Number of time steps in the output files.
4000         // Number of free-electron energy points in the output file freeDist.csv. (Not freeDistRaw.csv, as this saves the splines) 

// 
#LOAD
mol_template_backup  // Folder handle/name. The folder must be within AC4DC/output/__Molecular.
99999               // The time to load from <optional, default = +infinity>
// Whether to start with a time step size based on that defined in this file. If true, 
// the step size will start as the number of steps divided by the total simulation timespan.
// If false, the step size will be the difference in time between the step loaded and the previous step. <optional, default = false>
false            

#DEBUG
999           // Simulation cutoff time in fs. If this time is reached, the simulation will end and output the data as normal. Does not affect the time step size. <Optional>
