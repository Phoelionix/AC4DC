Notes:
Pulse energy 90 eV above Zn K edge 
Intensity was between 8e17 Wcm^-2 and 1.7e^18 Wcm^-2? This file assumes 1.25e18 Wcm^-2. EDIT: 1.5e18 W cm^-2
W = 6.242e18 eV/s = 6242 eV/fs = 0.64 9.75 keV ph / fs.
cm^-2 = 10^-8 um^-2
So 1.25e18*0.64*1e-8 = 8e9 ph/fs at peak

Peak power = 0.94*E/FWHM
-> fluence = 10/0.94*8e9 = 8.5e10 ph/um^2

But if was given as average intensity (like in a square pulse), then the fluence is
8e9*10 = 8e10
