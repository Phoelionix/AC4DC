Notes:
L2 and L3 edge of Gd is 7930 and 7242. https://www.ruppweb.org/Xray/elements.html. Galli used 8480 eV.
Due to approximations (such as removing the 5th shell) and without relativistic effects, the HF code puts the L shell at 7417 eV.  
We thus just use galli's 8480 eV, especially since recognising that the L1 edge will have very little effect with < 200 eV emissions.
This may overestimate the effect slightly due to the lower P electrons' potential likely placing them closer to the Anti-goldilocks range
