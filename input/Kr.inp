// Input for closed-shell Hartree-Fock calculations.
// Average over configuration fractional occupancy is supported, so closed orbitals can have ocuppancy between 0 and 4L+2.
LDA            // Hamiltonian form. Can be HF, LDA.
36              // Nuclear charge
coulomb      // Nuclear potential model. Can be "coulomb" for point-like nucleus, "sphere" for spherical nucleus.
// If it is "sphere", additional argument (nuclear radius) is expected in the same line after space.
1000          // Number of grid points
0.0001	     // Origin of the coordinate grid. Should be > 0.
100	         // Box radius, maximum distance from the nucleus.
// Orbitals and their occupancies
8	             // Number of orbitals

V_N       // Potential model. Can be "V_N" for Hartree-Fock, "V_N-1no" for non-orthogonal excited state orbitals, "V_N-1" for classical -1 potential (TODO).
length      // Gauge for matrix elements involving photon absorption/emission. Can be either "length" or "velocity".
// Parameters for time dynamics. The time interval is fixed and optimized to be 10x the width of the pulse.
8000        // Photon energy in keV.
1           // Pulse half-width in femtoseconds.
270         // Peak intensity in //x10^2 W/nm^2.
0        // Initial guess for number of time step points for rate equation. If the value is 0, program skips rate equation soluving step.
