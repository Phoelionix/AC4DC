Notes:
Parameters approximate (pump) pulse used in Nass et al 2020 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7156470/

Ignores:
- precipitant (NaCl)
- surrounding water, which would filter photoelectron distribution in crystal with own.
    - If photoelectrons aren't slowed by boundary significantly, this is on a timescale shorter 
    than the pulse.
- spatial boundary, since the water droplet size is unknown

from many runs, distributions are very well-approximated by low accuracy grid, 
for the purposes of both a) atomic form factor determination and b) debye length 
determination for hybrid models.
