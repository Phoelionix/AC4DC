#VOLUME
18.11        // Volume per molecule in Angstrom^3.
2000         // Length scale of sample in Angstrom. Used for effective escape rate of photo-electrons.
none // Spatial boundary shape - options are none, spherical, cylindrical, planar

#PULSE
6000         // Photon energy in eV.
10           // Pulse width in femtoseconds (defined as FWHM for Gaussian pulse).
2000         // Pulse fluence in 10^4 * J/cm^2.  // - At the focal point it was 2000 for HR, so the added 500 must be a correction accounting for energy from outside the focus? TODO Or it should be 2000. Still testing. - S.P.
square       // Pulse shape

#NUMERICAL
1500000          // (400k works for 35_100 grid) Initial guess for number of time step points for rate equation. If the value is 0, program skips rate equation solving step.
17            // Number of threads in OpenMP.
0             // [only for nonthermal] minimum free-electron energy in eV
10000          // [only for nonthermal] maximum free-electron energy in eV // This is important - S.P.
150           // total number of free-electron grid points
wiggledestruction        // electron grid type
50              // Number of "low-energy" grid points (hybrid & powerlaw grids only, not for hybrid_power grids though!!!)

1|2|35|45|80|105|165|170                // boundary indices, with first point excluded. No spaces. Last point overrides num free-e pnts for now. TODO could make it the num electrons in region or smth?

#OUTPUT

Y            // Write intensity in a separate file (Y/N)?
Y            // Write data for molecular dynamics (MD) in a separate file (Y/N)?

#DEBUG
